3. **Offering Reports**

   The offering report tool allows you to balance funds for each category before running the 
   report. The report can then be printed or saved to an excel spreadsheet. Optional items include:

   - Signature fields for those counting the offering.
   - Option to include the offering contribution entries in the report.
   - If contributions are included in the report you can also choose whether or not to include the 
     donors names.

   reports for all donors by clicking the generate all button. ![First Fruits report all](http://www.wardware.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/generateAllButton.png)
